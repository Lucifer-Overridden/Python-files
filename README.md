I am a novice programmer who is learning python and all of my codes are available in this repository

All the notes that I make while reading books or watching tutorials are also present in this repository for reference

_The codes are written by Lucifer_Overridden in the process of learning very basic concepts of python and hence it is advised to every student to repeat them to learn and teake complete benefit of this repository, also introspecting how the code works is very important_

```python
def learning(method):
   if method == practising :
       print("You are doing a great job \n And keep it up")
   elif method != practising :
       print("you should improve your ways an start practising \n That would be very helpful in making you a better coder afterwards")
```
